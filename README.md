# rmathlib

This is a simple C/C++ math library for my projects. You can choose the corresponding implementation file (<code>rmathlib.c</code> or <code>rmathlib.cpp</code>) to copy and paste.

## Features

- 2D, 3D and 4D vector operations
- 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrix operations
- Trigonometric functions (32 and 64 bit results)
- Random API
- Computer Graphics operations
- Planar Geometry operations
- C11 and C++11 support

## How to Use

Copy and paste the <code>rmathlib.h</code> and <code>rmathlib.c</code> (or <code>rmathlib.cpp</code>) files into your projects and include the header file in any source files needed.

Take a look in <code>main.c</code> (or <code>main.cpp</code>) to see some examples of how to use the library in a source file.

Running <code>make</code> and then <code>make run</code> will run the main.c executable. And <code>make cpp</code> then <code>make run</code> will run the main.cpp executable.
